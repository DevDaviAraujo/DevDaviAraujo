- Grettings, I’m @DevDaviAraujo a south american junior dev and SENAI's top student of all time (i wish it was true), i'm great at lissening, i try my best to be very focused, and i have alot of will to do great things
with the tool's life gives me. I have a great interest in technology in general, it came to me since i was a kid and loved to play games. To me, being a part of the future of my generation and this topic is a
plasure and i'm gratefull for that.

I currently develop web aplications and sites as my chores at SENAI, i'm using PHP and MySQL as my Back-End and DataBase Managment/Development, and CSS3, HTML5 and BOOTSTRAP at the Front-End for my web projects.
But, i'm also familiar and developed in other levels with languages like JavaScript and C++ (i began from this one).

Looking for a first job in the as an IT worker, any areas of service i'll be gratefull.
